### 👩‍💻 About Me

I’m a freelance coder always on the lookout for new opportunities and interesting projects! My main focus is on **C#** and **Python**, but I also enjoy working with **Swift** and **Java**. I am always looking to expand my skills and continue growing them.

- 🌱 **Forever Learner:** Every win and every fail is a lesson. I post all my code—successes and not-yet-successes—because I believe in learning from both. Sometimes a “loss” today becomes a big “win” tomorrow!
- 🏆 **Project Leader:** Led my senior college capstone project, partnering with campus security to build a web solution for the Campus Security Shuttle Service. The project helped streamline safe ride requests and reduce phone line congestion.
- 🕹️ **Inspired by Games:** My coding journey took off in college, inspired by the fact that one of my favorite games, **Stardew Valley**, was built in C#. That connection sparked my curiosity and set me on this path!
- 🛡️ **Current Hobby:** My favorite thing is learning. So on my Linkedin account you'll find me posting about code snippets, then there is the posts about the certificates and certifications I earned from Linkedin Learning, and (my personal favorite) has been Cybersecurity related as I like to post TryHackMe focused badges as well as the highlights on completeted rooms.

### 🎮 Fun Fact

I love games! My coding ambitions were sparked by learning that **Stardew Valley** was coded in C#—and it just so happened to be the main language taught at my college. Games continue to inspire me to build, learn, and improve every day.

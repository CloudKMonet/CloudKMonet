### 👩‍💻 About Me

I’m a freelance coder always on the lookout for new opportunities and interesting projects! My main focus is on **C#** and **Python**, but I also enjoy working with **Swift** and **Java**. I am always looking to expand my skills and continue growing them.

- 🌱 **Forever Learner:** Every win and every fail is a lesson. I post all my code—successes and not-yet-successes—because I believe in learning from both. Sometimes a “loss” today becomes a big “win” tomorrow!
- 🏆 **Project Leader:** Led my senior college capstone project, partnering with campus security to build a web solution for the Campus Security Shuttle Service. The project helped streamline safe ride requests and reduce phone line congestion.
- 🕹️ **Inspired by Games:** My coding journey took off in college, inspired by the fact that one of my favorite games, **Stardew Valley**, was built in C#. That connection sparked my curiosity and set me on this path!
- 🛡️ **Current Hobby:** My favorite thing is learning. So on my Linkedin account you'll find me posting about code snippets, then there is the posts about the certificates and certifications I earned from Linkedin Learning, and (my personal favorite) has been Cybersecurity related as I like to post TryHackMe focused badges as well as the highlights on completeted rooms.

### 🚀 Featured Project

#### Campus Security Shuttle Web Solution
> **Context:** My Top featured project is from my college senior capstone. A security guard at our college came by our classroom to ask for students who could take on a big project in a short amount of time. The project in question was to develop a web application. The web application would support students and campus security; as it would field students ride requests, keep a ticket history of the requests, check if the student was flagged for regular requests (or had a doctor's note), as well as send a message to any student requesting a ride if an emergecy occurs and haults the requests. Campus security also wanted to keep tangible data of the students ride requests (a database mock-up was required to keep track of the ticket history by log student's by id number, the driver's id number, when the ride was begun, when the ride ended and a short decription of the ticket's requested location picku/drop off), this would quantify whether or not more investment could be justified for college security's campus vans as they would be driving around campus responding to the safe ride requests.
> **Role:** Project Team Leader- I became the project team leader midway through the project. This was to help balance out roles and facilitate a schedule between my teammates, the professor, and the client when we woud need to check in about features, progress, and fulfill some basic project management roles (upkeeping morale, sending practical end of the week progress report as well as project to-do lists at the beginning of the week, consident deliverables were being met, as well as check in with the client about details on the projects desired features).
> **Goal:** Streamline student ride requests for campus safe rides and reduce phone congestion for campus security.  
> **Impact:** Provided a web interface for shuttle requests thereby making getting a ride around campus safer and freeing up security resources- the web interface was active and readily available for two different presentations. One to some of our campus' private investors, and the second was to the person directly in charge of campus security (the financial side of it) above the campus security head of staff.

### 🎮 Fun Fact

I love games! My coding ambitions were sparked by learning that **Stardew Valley** was coded in C#—and it just so happened to be the main language taught at my college. Games continue to inspire me to build, learn, and improve every day.
